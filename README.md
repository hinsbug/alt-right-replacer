alt-right-replacer
=============

the beginnings of a Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'alt-right' with 'neo-Nazi'.
Based on [Zeke Weeks](https://github.com/zekeweeks)'s [millenials-begone](https://github.com/zekeweeks/millennials-begone) which was based on [Steven Frank](http://stevenf.com/)'s [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt).

Right after I started writing this extension in November, someone else made an extension just like it that got written about in HuffPost. See [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-chrome-extension-replaces-alt-right-with-white-supremacy_us_583c6106e4b09b60560157b6)
This was my first ever Chrome extension though so I wanted to finish it & put it up for my own reference. Enjoy & feel free to offer improvements!
